# journal
a minetest mod that adds a journal  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/theFox6/journal_modpack.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/theFox6/journal_modpack)

It's a book that can be accessed from the inventory.  
The journal can be used for adding story to minetest.  
You can also write your own notes into it ingame.

## pirate story
There are not many mods that use journal yet.
Because of that an example (pirate_story) is included in the modpack.
It's recommended to have default from minetest_game enabled to play the story.
Look at the code and write your own stories everyone!!! (pls)
